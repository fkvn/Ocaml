(* Problem 1. *)
(* 1.a. Using map, write a function that takes a list of pairs
   of integers, and produces a list of the sums of the pairs. 

   e.g., list_add [(1,3); (4,2); (3,0)] = [4; 6; 3]
*)
let list_add (lst:(int*int) list) : int list =
  map (fun (x, y) -> x + y) lst
;;

assert (list_add [(1,3); (4,2); (3,0)] = [4; 6; 3]);;



(* 1.b. Write list_add directly using reduce.
*)
let list_add_reduce (lst:(int*int) list) : int list =
  reduce (fun (x, y) b -> (x + y)::b ) [] lst
;;

assert (list_add_reduce [(1,3); (4,2); (3,0)] = [4; 6; 3]);;




(* Problem 2. *)
(* Using reduce, write a function that takes a list of optional integers,
   and filters out all of the Noneâ€™s.

   e.g., filter_none [Some 0; Some 2; None; Some 1] = [0;2;1]
*)
let filter_none (lst:int option list) : int list =
  reduce (
    fun x b ->
    match x with
     | Some v -> v :: b
     | None -> b
  ) [] lst
;;

assert (filter_none [Some 0; Some 2; None; Some 1] = [0;2;1]);;
